Library
-------

Configure the library:

 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/installation/directory

Build the library:

 $ make all

Install the library:

 $ make install

The libraries are now located in the /path/to/installation/directory/lib
directory and the header files in the /path/to/installation/directory/include/platine_env_plane
directory.

Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

 $ make doc

Open the ./doc/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.

If you want to clean the documentation:

 $ make clean-doc


Tests
-------------------

Run the functional tests and non-regression tests:

 $ make check
