2023-07-25 opensand-7.0.0

   * Rework memory model in the opensand-rt library
       * No more bare pointers + length: using unique_ptr with custom deleter instead (a.k.a. Rt::Ptr)

2022-03-13 opensand-6.1.1

2022-12-12 opensand-6.1.0

   * Added support for ubuntu 22.04 (jammy)
   * The satellite can work again on regenerative mode. We have recovered the
     regenerative satellite (at different levels) with a new design and a
     modular approach. The satellite can now work on transparent mode, on
     IP-regenerative mode and on BBFRAME-regenerative mode.
   * OpenSAND has evolved to allow for a satellite constellation (up to two
     satellites, as of now) and an emulated Inter-satellite Link (ISL) with a
     variable delay between the satellites.

2022-05-18 opensand-6.0.1

   * Fix SCPC
   * Fix QoS with strict priority

2022-04-12 opensand-6.0.0

   * A new web interface that replaces the manager and that allows to:
       * Create the OpenSAND configuration.
       * Deploy the configuration and start/stop the OpenSAND binaries (STs, GWs et SAT).
       * Monitor the status of the binaries.
   * The daemons are not anymore available and the network configuration is now external to OpenSAND, but we provide several solutions:
       * A manual showing a simple setup from CLI is available
       * Easy-to-use makefiles are available in order to configure/clean your network topology for different use-cases (IP/Ethernet with/without VLAN and with QoS mapping)
   * Implementation of a SARP learning mechanism given that for full-Ethernet use-cases, work-stations MAC addresses are needed in the SARP table.
   * Bug correction on the ACM loop (concerning the MODCOD selection).
   * Minor bug correction on the VBDC algorithm.

2020-04-24 opensand-5.2.0
