Library
-------

Configure the library:

 $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/installation/directory

Build the library:

The libraries are now located in the /path/to/installation/directory/lib
directory and the header files in the /path/to/installation/directory/include/opensand_conf
directory.

Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

If you want to clean the documentation:

 $ make clean-doc
